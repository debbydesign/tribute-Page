    <h3 class="early-life"> Mae Early Life</h3>

    <div class="early-life-paragraph">
      <p>As a child, Mae loved to read, especially books about science and astronomy.
      By the time she was in kingdergarten, she knew she wanted to become a scientist.
      This, howeve, didn't keep her from other passions. Mae also wanted to be a dancer
      , and throughout her youths, she studied every type of dance.</p>
      <p>In college in the 1970s, Mae double-majored in chemical engineering and African
      American studied. When she learned about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., she saw his
      work as a call to action to help people, so after graduating, she decided to become
      a doctor.</p>
      <p>She joined the Peace Corps in 1983 and travled to West Africa on a two-year
      program to provide medical assistance to those in need. After returing, she saw
      major changes taking place at NASA. In 1983, for example, Sally Ride became the
      first American woman in space. Mae had always imagined herself in space but was
      hesitant to pursue that dream. But it was seeing the actress Nichelle Nichols play
      Lieutenant Uhura in the TV show<em> Star Trek</em> that finally inspiried her to
      apply to the space program. in 1987, Mae became the first black woman in the
      astronaut training program, and a few years later she flew into orbit as the first
      African American woman in space.</p>
      <p>Mae still wanted to have a direct impact on people, so she left NASA in 1993 and
      created her own company, the Jemison Group, which researches ways technology can
      help people in their daily lives. She also started the Dorothy Jemison Foundation
      for Excellence, which in 1994 launched The Earth We Share, a science camp for children.

        You can hear other people's wisdom, but you've got to re-evaluate the world for yourself."
